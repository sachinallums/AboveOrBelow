# scsnl-aboveorbelow

A project created for the Stanford Cognitive Systems and Neuroscience Laboratory during the summer of 2023.

## About

This project was initially created in Flutter Flow to quickly create UI/UX designs and then converted into Flutter and integrated with Firebase to allow for more complex data collection for an academic study. Above or Below is one game of a suite of 7 different games all aimed at helping children with mathematical dyscalculia subitize different quantities of numbers and improve their number sense. This specific game presents children with anywhere from 3 to 5 different answer choices and a target number. Children will be asked to select the answer choice that is either one greater than or one less than the target number in quantity. The size of the numbers, as well as the number of answer choices and whether the numbers are in a symbolic or non-symbolic form (i.e. dots or arabic numerals), will get increasingly difficult as the player progresses.
